# learn-typescript

This repository documents my progress on learning the superset language of
JavaScript - TypeScript. If you've found yourself her, feel free to clone the
repository onto your environment and maybe you'll learn something too.

## setup

Once cloned, open the folder in your editor of choice with TypeScript language
support (I use VScode) and you can view any of the TypeScript (.ts) files. To
compile any of the TypeScript files to JavaScript files, you will need a
compiler. Here is the npm command to install the latest stable version of
typescript from npm globally:

```
npm install -g typescript
```
